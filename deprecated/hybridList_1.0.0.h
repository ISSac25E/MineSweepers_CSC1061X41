/*
  This class will aim to create a hybrid between linked lists and array lists
  This will essentially be a series of lists linked together to create one seemingly continuous list

  The User defines the size of each sub-list. Smaller sub-list results in less initial memory usage but worse memory efficiency at a large scale.

  'hybridList' requires the 'linkedList' class

  here is an overview of a hybrid list:
  [list 0] -> [list 1] -> [list 2]

  insertion and deletion will result in the standard O(n) time complexity as a result of shifting data around
  however, resizing the list is much faster as a result of having the data striped over multiple lists
  searching specific indexes is significantly faster especially with larger sub lists compared to a linked list solution
